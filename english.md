"第一段He swallowed hard and nodded. The next day, I announced to all my students that I'd be offering an after-school study hall Monday through Friday. Anthony was the first student to show up. A couple of days later, Terrell joined him.Before long, I had a room full of eighth graders who sometimes stayed until five o'clock to work on their lessons. I never asked why any of them were there, but I soon had a large collection of "I don't have my homework because..." stories. All were very real.None were amusing."
"第二段The things I learned that year weren't taught in the education classes I'd taken in college. I discovered that not all kids come from homes that are safe and warm and dry. Not all kids have a quiet bedroom with a desk and study light and plenty of school supplies. Some don't have a home where a parent is even around. And some kids really do go to bed hungry. Most importantly, I learned that "I'll listen" works a whole lot better than "No excuses!" Every student is an angel in my heart, who should be cherished."
